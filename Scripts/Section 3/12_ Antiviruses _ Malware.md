# Antiviruses & Malware

Antiviruses are a sensitive topic in the privacy and security community, so I will
try to stay impartial. This is a topic that you absolutely need to understand the
difference between privacy and security, so if you haven’t already seen section 1
of the course where I break those concepts down, you need to go back and watch
that.

We all know that the internet can be a dangerous place. There are scammers,
hackers, but the most frequent issue we hear about is viruses, a form of malware.
We’ve grown up being taught you need to have an antivirus on your computer, or
else you will get viruses. This is also pushed by antivirus companies themselves
(for obvious financial reasons) and these services do everything possible to latch
onto your computer, as made famous by John McAfee himself.

Let’s start with the pro to antiviruses: They are generally good for your security.
They continually scan your system for malware and vulnerabilities, they check
every websites you visit, scan email attachments, and they can sometimes include
tools like password managers and payment- specific security features.

But, and this is that big butt...it is probably one of the worst things you can do for
your privacy. Antiviruses need to scan every file on your computer, every website
you visit, and all of your personal data. They almost always collect everything
flowing in and out of your computer, and admit to collecting this information. Go
read your antivirus’s privacy policy on their website.

For this course, we need to be working towards security, and privacy. Which
makes this a very difficult topic, since antiviruses are generally good for security,
but detrimental to our privacy.

Every user will have different options, and to figure out where you should go from
here, there are three things you need to answer:

1. How strong is your ability to download from trusted sources with no
malicious intent? If you aren’t sure, then assume it’s not good.

2. What operating system are you using? Are you on Android, iOS, Windows,
MacOS, Linux, or something else? Different platforms have better security
than others, which may impact the need for an antivirus.

3. How good are your browsing habits? I covered these tips in our recent
lesson teaching the basic rules to avoid viruses, scams, and hackers from
invading your system.

After you’ve answered these three questions, I made this very convenient chart
you can use to help guide your decision. This is not supposed to be definitive
answer, but hopefully it’s a decent guide to demonstrate how to approach this
issue.

In short, I will always recommend having some line of defense on Windows as a
safety net. To combat privacy concerns, I recommend using Windows Defender
for moderate and advanced users. Despite popular belief, WD is able to compete
against many paid options out there. First, it’s free. Second, we know that
Windows is collecting your information anyway. So using our rules of minimalism,
we can simply say: “Hey! Microsoft already has our information, so let’s use their
antivirus, to avoid two companies getting access to the same data.” I hope this
acceptance of data control from Microsoft encourages you to switch over to
something more privacy-friendly like Linux, we’ll talk more about this later on in
Section 4.

On the other hand, if you’re a beginner and you seriously don’t trust yourself, you
may want to invest in a paid antivirus for better security. There will likely be a hit
to your privacy, but if you can’t properly secure yourself, that’s a sacrifice you’ll
have to make.

For MacOS, the likelihood of an infection is generally smaller than Windows
because it is a less targeted OS. Advanced users don’t typically need anything.
Beginners and moderate users may need to use an antivirus for peace of mind,
but it’s still not required. If you follow the basic guidelines we’ve discussed to
browse the internet, you should be safe on MacOS. But, still be cautious because
it’s more than possible to get infected, despite what Apple thinks.
On Linux, you almost never need an antivirus, at least as of today. Beginners may
want it for peace of mind, but I doubt many beginners will be using Linux in the
first place. No matter who you are, I would recommend doing occasional scans
using something like ClamAV to make sure nothing slipped.

On iOS, no antiviruses, ever. Anything that claims it’s protecting you is doing
more harm than good. iOS does not need an antivirus thanks to Apple’s heavy
restrictions on what apps can be downloaded to the device.

Android devices are a bit more open than iPhones. If you’re moderate or
advanced, you don’t need anything. If you’re a beginner, you CAN get one if you
download 3rd-party apps frequently, but it’s honestly still not recommended.

An option for any operating system is to upload a file you download to
VirusTotal, a web-based antivirus that utilizes different antivirus databases. It’s
nice, but do keep in mind their privacy policy is not very friendly.

The last thing everyone watching needs to understand is Antiviruses are not
intended to do the work for you. They are supposed to be used as a safety net in
case anything slips past you. So make sure to follow these tips to make protect
yourself as much as possible:

1. Go back to the “Your Browsing Habits” lesson and follow the rules of
browsing the internet safely.

2. Make sure you’re using a quality firewall, which will stop malicious incoming
and outgoing traffic requests. Windows comes with one, although there are
better solutions out there. MacOS has one, although when this script was
written, it was off by default, so make sure to enable it in your system
preferences. Linux offers firewalls as well. If you’re on Android, check out
netguard for similar functionality.

3. To avoid keyloggers from slipping past your setup, which is when someone
or a software captures your keystrokes, a virtual keyboard may help
depending on the keylogger’s sophistication. Or you can use a service like
Guarded ID to prevent hackers or malware from capturing your keystrokes
by scrambling everything you type. Another secret but hidden benefit to
using password managers is they eliminate the need to type a password
into websites, making them a small defense against the simplest
keyloggers.

4. The last tip is to make sure you’re aware of your ability to browse the
internet safely. Use an antivirus if you think you may need one, don’t be
overconfident.

To put everything together, I have a love-hate relationship with antiviruses, and
you should too. They will boost your security, at an enormous cost of your
privacy. You need to decide whether or not you need one, and that depends on
your experience, in combination with the operating system you’re using. I can’t
make the final decision for you, but I hope this lesson put you on the right track.

And that’s going to wrap up everything I have to say about antiviruses. Thank you
for watching this lesson, and I will see you in the next one, where I discuss file
deletion, and why emptying your recycle bin isn’t properly deleting your files. See
you soon.
