# Pre-configured Hardware & Software

Throughout this course, we’ve had to take insecure and/or unprivate pieces of
software and hardware, and modify them to our benefit. But, are there any
options out there that do this work for us? Luckily, at the time of making this
course, there are some projects and products I wanted to share with you that aim
to offer security, privacy, or both out of the box. It’s important for us to support
companies and projects that take this stuff seriously, and leave behind other
companies that don’t care.

Let’s start with software:

- Tor is preconfigured to boost your anonymity. It’s offered for free, and the
setup is extremely simple. Don’t forget about TailsOS and Whonix.

- Mozilla doesn’t have the world’s cleanest history, but Firefox and other
variants of Firefox deserve a huge shoutout.

- Brave has its share of problems, but attempting to bring privacy and
security to the masses is very admirable.

- The EFF is a wonderful organization who develops amazing software like
HTTPS Everywhere and Privacy Badger, as well as great advocacy. Check
their site for meetups so you can take action.

- Proton gives you a private and secure email, VPN, and more products with
a great track record.

- Searx.me, Startpage, and DuckDuckgo are all fantastic search engines.

- Veracrypt makes file and drive encryption easy and free.

- Most linux distributions are private and secure out of the box, emphasis on
most.

- GrapheneOS, and CalyxOS are excellent ROMs for android
devices.

- VirtualBox and KVM allow you to create virtual machines quickly and
easily.

- Libreboot and coreboot offers a FOSS bootloader for your machines.

- OpenWRT and PFsense both give you FOSS protection on your home
routers.

- And cryptocurrency projects like Monero offer private ways to
send payments to anyone around the world.

Those are just a few of many amazing projects out there. Moving to hardware:

- Purism, Pine, and System76 make private computers built from the ground
up with you in mind, as well as some phone options.

- The Ministry of Freedom pre-installs Libreboot and Linux on laptops,
making it easy for consumers to switch to Linux and Libreboot.

- The Ledger Nano is a cryptocurrency wallet allowing you to securely store
your coins, something we should be encouraging more often.

- The final and more unexpected devices that have your security in mind are
iPads and Chromebooks. We’ve discussed using these in the past for high
security, and low privacy activities; this includes personal banking,
personal email, and anything else that is inherently unprivate, but requires
a degree of security.

- Outside of these larger products and services, we have some smaller items you can buy
that we covered on our YouTube channel that we consider small boosts to your privacy and security
for very little money, like privacy screen protectors. 

And that’s it! My hope is that some of you watching this course have some
programming, engineering, or development experience. If so, I encourage you to
make a difference. This list was awesome, but it would be even better if it was
twice the size. If you have an idea or project that you need help with, make sure to
reach out to me because I would love to help you out in any way I can. Thank you
for watching, and I’ll see you in the next lesson: Downsides to Safety.
