# Shopping Safely

At this point in the course, you may be asking yourself about *(show groceries)*
shopping. How can you order from Amazon, privately and securely? What about
physical stores? This is tricky because it’s difficult to do. Stress on difficult,
because it’s not impossible! Let’s go ahead and cover different techniques and
methods we can use to make our shopping experiences, online and in-store,
safer; keep in mind this is a more extreme lesson, so those of you who draw your
convenience lines early may find this lesson out of your zone.

Let’s start with in-person stores, leaving the digital-side out of the equation.
Security-wise, we need to be careful, we don’t know how stores handle your data.
Target has been hacked, Home Depot, Wendy’s, Chipotle, Whole Foods, Sonic,
Under Armor, Panera Bread, Sears, and there are many more.

The best way to secure your information is by not giving your information. Here’s
how you do it:

1) Pay with cash as much as possible. Neither the store or your bank can
collect any data on your shopping habits.

2) If a store doesn’t take cash, you can use prepaid debit cards without your
information. Purchase the non-reloadable prepaid visa gift cards, like the
Vanilla Visa, and use falsified information if needed. The idea is to
purchase these \* show cash \* with cash, but if your threat model isn’t as
high, you can use your credit card to buy them. Watch out for reloadable
cards, since they require your real name, address, birth date, and social
security number. Keep in mind even when you buy prepaid cards, there will
be video cameras and other methods of tracking you within the store; not
to mention your trip to the store is tracked as well, so you’ll need a private
method of transportation --assuming your threat model is that extreme. A
side note for EU viewers, the website viabuy.com can get you a credit card
without credit checks or links to your bank account. Speaking of
credit...credit bureaus are widely known to share and sell user data, which
is why you may receive offers for other credit cards in the mail, you can opt
out of this by visiting this website and opting out.

3) If you don’t want to (or can’t) use cash or prepaid debit cards in a store,
and you’re set on paying with your personal debit or credit card, at least
implement basic security measures. Contact your bank to increase the
length of your PIN to at least 6 digits, preferably 8. Don’t sign the back of
your card, write “Ask for photo ID”. And consider investing in an RFID
blocking wallet or purse to protect your information from RFID attacks.

4) Avoid signing up for rewards programs and credit cards. If you do want to
open a rewards account, you don’t normally need to provide your real
information. \*cough\*

5) And the final step, go into every store with a pseudo. You never know when
people will ask for information, and if you’re not prepared, you’re going to
give your real information. Be prepared, like Japeth.

That wraps up physical stores! But what about digital shopping? Stores are being
hacked left and right, phishing attacks are never-ending, and your personal
information is constantly at risk. 

Let’s start with a popular website:
Amazon.

Amazon requires an email and a name, both of which don’t have to be
genuine...use a pseudonym. Remember to send packages to your pseudo’s PO
box or PMB, or you could ship to an Amazon Locker. Now, everything is private except payment--you have three options if
you don’t want the purchase tied to you.

1) The recommended payment option is to purchase an Amazon gift card at
a local store with cash. You can continue reloading your Amazon account
with gift cards indefinitely.

2) The second option, if you insist on paying with a card, is seeing if your
bank offers virtual expendable cards to protect your actual card. If this
isn’t possible, services like privacy.com or Blur offer similar functionality.
But, I would always recommend the gift card route--it is significantly more
robust.

3) As we mentioned earlier, you can use prepaid non-reloadable debit cards.

Congrats, you are now using Amazon privately and securely. Lucky for you, the
rules are extremely similar on other sites--with one main difference. Lots of sites
don’t require an account to make a purchase; if you can checkout as a guest,
take that route. Rather than using Amazon gift cards though, use prepaid debit
card and a pseudonym to make an account--if one is required. Don’t forget to
make purchases on a hardened browser, we covered this in section 3.

And that is how to shop safely. It’s important you take control of your data
because the places you shop don’t have your security and privacy on their
priority list. As always, thank you for watching, and I’ll see you in the next lesson:
Lifestyle Changes.
